# OmegA-engine

[![build](../../workflows/build/badge.svg)](../../actions?query=workflow%3Abuild)

This is a modern OpenArena engine aimed to be fast, secure and compatible with all existing OA mods.
It is based on [quake3e](https://github.com/ec-/Quake3e) with latest upstream fixes applied.

Go to [Releases](../../releases) section to download latest binaries for your platform or follow [Build Instructions](#build-instructions)

*This repository does not contain any game content so in order to play you must copy the resulting binaries into your existing OpenArena installation*

**Key features**:

* optimized OpenGL renderer
* optimized Vulkan renderer
* raw mouse input support, enabled automatically instead of DirectInput (**\in_mouse 1**) if available
* unlagged mouse events processing, can be reverted by setting **\in_lagged 1**
* **\in_minimize** - hotkey for minimize/restore main window (win32-only, direct replacement for Q3Minimizer)
* **\video-pipe** - to use external ffmpeg binary as an encoder for better quality and smaller output files
* significally reworked QVM (Quake Virtual Machine)
* improved server-side DoS protection, much reduced memory usage
* raised filesystem limits (up to 20,000 maps can be handled in a single directory)
* reworked Zone memory allocator, no more out-of-memory errors
* non-intrusive support for SDL2 backend (video, audio, input), selectable at compile time
* OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound quality)
* Optional Ogg Vorbis support
* [QWFWD](https://www.quakeworld.nu/wiki/QWfwd) proxy support from [fX3](https://codeberg.org/ChannelZ/fX3), [list of servers](https://www.quakeservers.net//quakeworld/servers/t=proxy/)
* console tabs from [fX3](https://codeberg.org/ChannelZ/fX3)
* tons of bug fixes and other improvements

## Vulkan renderer

Based on [Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition](https://github.com/kennyalive/Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition) with many additions:

* high-quality per-pixel dynamic lighting
* very fast flares (**\r_flares 1**)
* anisotropic filtering (**\r_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic**)
* greatly reduced API overhead (call/dispatch ratio)
* flexible vertex buffer memory management to allow loading huge maps
* multiple command buffers to reduce processing bottlenecks
* [reversed depth buffer](https://developer.nvidia.com/content/depth-precision-visualized) to eliminate z-fighting on big maps
* merged lightmaps (atlases)
* multitexturing optimizations
* static world surfaces cached in VBO (**\r_vbo 1**)
* useful debug markers for tools like [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/)
* fixed framebuffer corruption on some Intel iGPUs
* offscreen rendering, enabled with **\r_fbo 1**, all following requires it enabled:
* `screenMap` texture rendering - to create realistic environment reflections
* multisample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_multisample**)
* supersample anti-aliasing (**\r_ext_supersample**)
* per-window gamma-correction which is important for screen-capture tools like OBS
* you can minimize game window any time during **\video**|**\video-pipe** recording
* high dynamic range render targets (**\r_hdr 1**) to avoid color banding
* bloom post-processing effect
* arbitrary resolution rendering
* greyscale mode

In general, not counting offscreen rendering features you might expect from 10% to 200%+ FPS increase comparing to KE's original version

Highly recommended to use on modern systems

## OpenGL renderer

Based on classic OpenGL renderers from [idq3](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena)/[ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3)/[cnq3](https://bitbucket.org/CPMADevs/cnq3)/[openarena](https://github.com/OpenArena/engine), features:

* OpenGL 1.1 compatible, uses features from newer versions whenever available
* high-quality per-pixel dynamic lighting, can be triggered by **\r_dlightMode** cvar
* merged lightmaps (atlases)
* static world surfaces cached in VBO (**\r_vbo 1**)
* all set of offscreen rendering features mentioned in Vulkan renderer, plus:
* bloom reflection post-processing effect

Performance is usually greater or equal to other opengl1 renderers
